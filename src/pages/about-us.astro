        <p class="text-xl text-gray-600 max-w-3xl mx-auto">
          The Apostle Paul exhorted Timothy to "guard the good deposit ... with the help of the Holy Spirit" (2 Timothy 1:14). Like Timothy, every ministry has a good deposit that must be guarded. In Every Nation, our foundational values articulate for us the good deposit we as a ministry must guard together, lest they be lost. Whether we're building a discipleship group, a music group, or planting a new church, these core values are the essential issues and help describe how we build.

            God's heart is to reach the lost, we're passionate about preaching the gospel and doing ministry in a way that engages people outside of the Christian faith. We seek to build churches primarily through evangelism, not transfer.

Family is the foundation and validation of ministry, therefore we refuse to sacrifice our marriages and our children on the altars of temporal justice. And because we believe God has called us to be a spiritual family, we embrace community, reject the idea of disposable relationships, and choose to walk in love, respect, and unity.

          <p class="text-gray-700">
            
We Believe...
. . . In the Holy Scriptures as originally given by God, divinely inspired, infallible, entirely trustworthy, and the supreme authority in all matters of faith and conduct.

. . . In one God, eternally existent in three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.

. . . In our Lord Jesus Christ, God manifested in the flesh, his virgin birth, his sinless human life, his divine miracles, his vicarious and atoning death, his bodily resurrection, his ascension, his mediatorial work, and his personal return in power and glory.

. . . In the salvation of lost and sinful man through the shed blood of the Lord Jesus Christ by faith apart from works, and regeneration by the Holy Spirit.

. . . In the Holy Spirit, by whose indwelling the believer is enabled to live a holy life, to witness and work for the Lord Jesus Christ.

. . . In the unity of the spirit of all true believers—the Church, the Body of Christ.

. . . In the resurrection of both the saved and the lost: they that are saved unto the resurrection of life, and they that are lost unto the resurrection of damnation.

We adhere to the World Evangelical Alliance Statement of Faith.
